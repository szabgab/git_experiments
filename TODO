- Create a local branch make some change merge
- Create several local branches, make changes to them and merge them in some interesting order
- Let's call this local repo (A)
  Create another local clone (B) from Github, make changes there, push them to master on Github
  make local changes in A as well, try to push them out when there is no conclict.
  Repeate above exercise but create a conflicting change 
- Create a branch in A and push it to Github


- Make some local changes when recognizing I need to do some other small change (e.g. a refactoring)
  before that change.
  Save the current changes
  Go back to the original
  Make the other changes (e.g. refactoring)
  commit the changes
  come back to where I was earlier to continue what I have been doing

- Fork on Github ...
